I'm excited to be taking this class because I believe it will aid me in creating more sophisticated code. With the knowledge of this class, I'm hoping I'll be able to reap several tools which I can use in industry and maximize efficiency in my own algorithms. I'm a bit worried about all the things people say about this class but I'm hoping if I dedicate a lot of time to it and maintain a positive outlook the rest will follow. I know this class opens many door ways so I intend on taking it very seriously. Anyways I'm gonna end it there as I don't know what else to write.
